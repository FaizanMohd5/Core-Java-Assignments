2) Define a class Person with name, age as instance variables. Define three 
overloaded versions of setPerson() in the class as instance methods, first version take
name only, second version take age only, and third version take both.

Code:

package Inheritance.polymorph;

public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    public void setPerson(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public void setPerson(int age)  {
        this.age = age;
    }
    public void setPerson(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

package Inheritance;

import Inheritance.polymorph.Person;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p1 = new Person();
        p1.setPerson(12);

        Person p2 = new Person();
        p2.setPerson("Jake");

        Person p3 = new Person();
        p3.setPerson("AJ",25);
    }
}

3) Define a rectangle calss with length, breadth and border colour as instance variables.
Provide instance methods setLength(), setBreadth(), setColour(), getLength(), getBreadth(),
 getColour() and printRectangleColout(). Create a subclass FilledRectangle of rectangle class
 with fill colour (inside region of rectangle) as instance variable. Provide setters and getters
 along with overridden method printRectangleColour() to display border colour as well as filled
 colour.
