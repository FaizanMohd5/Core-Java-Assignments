1) Define a Java class Person with private instance variables name and age. Also define
setters and getters (as protected members). Define Employee class by extending Person
with property salary. Also define public methods input and display Employee's name, age 
and salary.

Code:

package Inheritance;

class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    protected String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    protected void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    protected int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
    protected void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}

class Employee extends Person {
    private float salary;
    public void setDetails(String name, int age, float salary) {
        setName(name);
        setAge(age);
        this.salary = salary;
    }
    public void displayDetails()    {
        System.out.println("Name: "+getName());
        System.out.println("Age: "+getAge());
        System.out.println("Salary: "+salary);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee e1 = new Employee();
        e1.setDetails("Serena",24,450000);
        e1.displayDetails();
    }
}

2) Define a class Account with properties account number and balance as private members.
Also define protected methods to access balance. Write a class Customer with account 
and customer name as private instance members. Define public methods to deposit, withdraw 
and check balance. Both the classes should reside in different packages. If you are facing
problem in implementing this problem then propose an idea to resolve the issue, also
implement your idea.

Code:

package extra;

public class Account {
    private int accountNumber;
    private float balance;
    public int getAccountNumber() {
        return accountNumber;
    }
    public void setAccountNumber(int accountNumber) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
    }
    protected float getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
    protected void setBalance(float balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }
}

package Inheritance;
import extra.Account;
public class Customer extends Account{
    private Account account;
    private String customerName;
    public void depositMoney(float amount) {
        setBalance(getBalance()+amount);
    }
    public void withdrawMoney(float amount) {
        setBalance(getBalance()-amount);
    }
    public void checkBalance()  {
        System.out.println("Your current bank balance is "+getBalance());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Customer c1 = new Customer();
        c1.setAccountNumber(1331334563);
        c1.setBalance(56000f);
        c1.withdrawMoney(4000f);
        c1.checkBalance();
        c1.depositMoney(6000f);
        c1.checkBalance();
    }
}


3) Define two classes Learner and Admin to represent users of an online learning platform.
Implement concept of generalisation and introduce a super class of Learner and Admin. Take
the liberty to decide number of members of the classes.

Code:



4) Define a class Cicle with radius as instance variable. Provide setter and getter.
Also define methods to calculate area of circle. Dreate a class ThickCircle as a subclass
of Circle with instance variable thickness. Define method to calculate thickness area of 
circle and hollow space area of circle.

Code:


5) Define a class Contact with instance variables name and mobile. Provide setters and 
getters in the class. Create a class DetailedContact as a subclass to provide additional
properties like email and date of birth. Provide setters and getters in the class.

Code:
